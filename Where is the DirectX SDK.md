从Windows 8开始，DirectX SDK被包含在Windows SDK中，成为了Windows SDK的一部分。

> We originally created the DirectX SDK as a high-performance platform for game development on top of Windows. As DirectX technologies matured, they became relevant to a broader range of applications. Today, the availability of Direct3D hardware in computers drives even traditional desktop applications to use graphics hardware acceleration. In parallel, DirectX technologies are more integrated with Windows. DirectX is now a fundamental part of Windows.
